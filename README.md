# Neural-Network-Handwritten

Hi there!

This is a small model which is set to shown how a small neural network (NN) works for trying to predict
the handwritten numbers in a 28x28 pixels square.

The Epochs can be modified and the neurons can be added for better performance you are free to use it and test it with your 
own handwritten numbers.

Hope you enjoy it and learn a bit more of NN.
